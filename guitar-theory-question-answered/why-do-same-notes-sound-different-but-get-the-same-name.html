  <h1>How can two notes have the same name but sound different?</h1>

  <p><em>In music, notes that sound an octave apart share the same name because they’re acoustically related by a 2:1 frequency ratio.</em></p>

  <blockquote>Two notes can share the same name but sound different because they&#39;re octave equivalents&mdash;versions of the same pitch class.</blockquote>

  <p>The <strong>E</strong> on your guitar&#39;s open 6th string (open low E) and the <strong>E</strong> on the open 1st string (open high E) share the same <em>note name</em>, yet they sound different (one &quot;low&quot;, and one &quot;high&quot;). In music, we treat pitches that sound similar&mdash;like they &quot;belong together&quot;&mdash;as members of the same <strong>pitch class</strong>. Just as dark red and light red can both be called <em>red</em>, low and high versions of E are both called <em>E</em>.</p>

  <p>This relationship between &quot;same-name notes&quot; is called <strong>octave equivalence</strong>. When two pitches vibrate at a 2:1 frequency ratio, the ear hears them as versions of the same musical identity.</p>

  <h2>🎸 Guitar Example</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Low E (6th string open)</strong> = 82.4 Hz</li>
    <li><strong>E on the 2nd fret of the 4th string</strong> = 164.8 Hz</li>
    <li><strong>High E (1st string open)</strong> = 329.6 Hz</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The high E vibrates exactly twice as fast as the E that is &quot;one octave&quot; below (the E on the 4th string) because 329.6 Hz is twice that of 164.8 Hz. And that E note vibrates exactly twice as fast as the low E on the 6th string because 164.8 Hz is twice that of 82.4 Hz. That 2:1 ratio is what makes them sound related&mdash;even though one is much higher.</p>

  <h2>💡 Why It Matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Recognize repeating note names across the fretboard</li>
    <li>Build chords and scales that &quot;fit&quot; together</li>
    <li>Hear patterns in melody and harmony more clearly</li>
  </ul>
