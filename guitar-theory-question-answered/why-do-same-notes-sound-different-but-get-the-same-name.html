  <h1>How can two notes have the same name but sound different?</h1>

  <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Two notes can share the same name but sound different because they’re higher or lower versions of the same pitch class—like shades of the same color.</p>

  <p>The <strong>E</strong> on your guitar’s 6th string (open low E) and the <strong>E</strong> on the 1st string (open high E) share the same <em>note name</em>, yet they sound an octave apart. In music, we treat pitches that sound similar—like they “belong together”—as members of the same <strong>pitch class</strong>. Just as dark red and light red are both called <em>red</em>, low and high versions of E are both called <em>E</em>.</p>

  <p>This relationship between “same-name notes” is called <strong>octave equivalence</strong>. When two pitches vibrate at a 2:1 frequency ratio, the ear hears them as versions of the same musical identity.</p>

  <h2>🎸 Guitar Example</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Low E (6th string open)</strong> = 82.4 Hz</li>
    <li><strong>High E (1st string open)</strong> = 329.6 Hz</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The high E vibrates exactly twice as fast as the low E two octaves below. That 2:1 ratio is what makes them sound related—even though one is much higher.</p>

  <h2>💡 Why It Matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Recognize repeating note names across the fretboard</li>
    <li>Build chords and scales that “fit” together</li>
    <li>Hear patterns in melody and harmony more clearly</li>
  </ul>
